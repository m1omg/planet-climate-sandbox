//

// this expression *peaks* at 283 W/m^2, which is the Simpson-Nakajima limit

// badly wrong -- it made every doubling hit harder than the last, so a couple of

// hundred times pre-industrial or beyond (Ramirez et al. 2014; Goldblatt 2013).
//
// A_CO2 sets the forcing per doubling, P_CO2 the amount at which the band core
// saturates and the logarithm takes over. The second term is the

// and what carries Venus's 92 bar to an optical depth of 35.
